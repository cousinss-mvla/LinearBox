LinearBox is a naive Linear Algebra library built for learning purposes alongside a self-study Linear Algebra course. 
By implementing the techniques I learn in code, I am able to more deeply understand them in a language I am very familiar with, and - as an auxiliary reward - compute solutions to tedious problems with my own work instead of external calculators.
